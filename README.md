# human-following-bot
## First Project using arduino uno.
A simple bot which utilises IR and Ultrasonic sensors.

### Components Used:

   1.Arduino UNO X 1
   
   2.12V geared Motor X 2
   
   3.9V Battery X 2
   
   4.Castor Wheel X 1
   
   5.Metal Chasis X 1
   
   6.Wheels X 2
   
   7.Breadboard X 1
   
   8.IR sensors X 3
   
   9.Ultrasonic Sensor X 1
   
   10.Electrical tools and connecting wires
  
 I used Arduino IDE, an almost C++ copy that makes it easy to connect the arduino board with our laptops to communicate with them.
  
  Side note:
  
  1.All of these components can be found in a baisc arduino kit online.
  
  2.The sensitivity of the sensors were fun to calibrate to get the best outcome.
  
  3.Its still a basic bot which has just touched the realm of being autonomous,hoping to work on a similar project later.

Cheers!!!
